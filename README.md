### React Workshop Project

This project is the culmination of our React workshop, designed to provide a hands-on experience with modern web development practices. Built using React, TypeScript, and Vite, this setup offers a minimal yet robust foundation for developing React applications with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), streamlined for both learning and scalability.

#### Technologies Used:
- **React**: For building user interfaces with components.
- **TypeScript**: Adding type safety to our JavaScript code for more robust applications.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience.
- **TailwindCSS**: For utility-first CSS styling to rapidly style our components.
- **ESLint**: To enforce code style and catch various types of errors early in the development process.

#### Project Structure:

- **public/**: Contains static assets like images and stylesheets.
  - `react.svg`: React logo.
  - `tailwind.svg`: TailwindCSS logo.
  - `vite.svg`: Vite logo.

- **src/**: The source code of our application.
  - **components/**: Reusable React components.
    - `Counter.tsx`: A simple counter component.
    - `Posts.tsx`: Component for displaying a list of posts.
    - `Todo.tsx`: Todo list component.
  - **lib/**: Library code and helpers.
    - `utils.ts`: Utility functions used across the application.
  - `App.tsx`: The main application component.
  - `index.css`: Global styles for the application.
  - `main.tsx`: The entry point for the Vite application.
  - `vite-env.d.ts`: TypeScript declarations for Vite-specific types.

- **.eslintrc.cjs**: ESLint configuration file for code linting.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- **README.md**: This file, containing project documentation.

#### Getting Started:

1. Clone this repository to start with the project code.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Execute `npm run dev` to launch the Vite development server. Access your project at `http://localhost:3000`.
4. Explore and modify the React components within the `src/components` directory.
5. Use `npm run build` to compile your application for production.

#### Expanding Your Application:
Feel free to expand upon this project by integrating additional features, refining the UI with TailwindCSS, or exploring more complex state management solutions. This project serves as a starting point for your journey into React development and beyond.
